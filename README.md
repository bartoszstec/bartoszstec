## Hi there 👋
I'm Bartosz — a Computer Science graduate (B.Eng.) and current Master's student passionate about **building AI-powered web applications**.  
I love combining machine learning with full-stack development to create projects that are both **smart** and **interactive**.  
My main goal is to develop in the field of **applied AI**.

# 📂 Latest Projects:

### 🛍️ [ecommerce-sentiment-analysis-ml-system](https://github.com/bartoszstec/ecommerce-sentiment-analysis-ml-system/tree/main)
Python | Flask | Machine Learning | Random Forest | Natural Language Processing | Sentiment Analysis | scikit-learn | spaCy | E-commerce


Web-based e-commerce platform enhanced with a custom machine learning model. Developed as my engineering thesis from scratch, the system integrates a Flask backend with a javascript frontend and employs a Scikit-learn Random Forest model trained on hybrid data. It automatically classifies user opinions as positive, negative, or neutral to improve product discovery and overall user experience.

### 🎮 [rl-tic-tac-toe-dual-agent-qlearning](https://github.com/bartoszstec/tic_tac_toe)
Python | Flask | REST API | Reinforcement Learning | Q-learning | NumPy | SciPy | Data Visualization

Interactive Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent trained from scratch using Q-learning reinforcement learning. This full-stack application combines a JavaScript Canvas frontend with a Python Flask backend, where the AI learns optimal strategy through self-play. The project also includes game history tracking and training visualizations to observe the learning process.
