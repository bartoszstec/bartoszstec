- **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, SQL
- **Machine Learning / Data Science:** NLP, Classification, Reinforcement Learning, numpy, pandas, spaCy
- **Tools:** Git, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Other experience:** Java, PHP (past projects)


## 🎓 Education  
**B.Eng. in Computer Science** – University of Silesia<br>
Specialization: Designing of Web Application
Currently pursuing **M.Sc. in Computer Science**, focusing on AI applications.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🛍️ [Shoop - ML-powered E-commerce](https://github.com/bartoszstec/Shoop-machine-learning/tree/automatic)
A web-based e-commerce platform integrated with a custom-built classification model. It helps in categorizing products and enhancing user experience.<br>
 Tech stack: **Vue.js, Flask, and Scikit-learn**  
- Developed as my engineering thesis from scratch (data collection, preprocessing, model training, integration).
- ML model (Random Forest) trained on real-world e-commerce reviews.
- Classifies customer opinions as positive,negative or neutral to enhance user experience.
