## Hi there 👋
I'm Bartosz — a Computer Science graduate (B.Eng.) and current Master's student passionate about **building AI-powered web applications**.  
I love combining machine learning with full-stack development to create projects that are both **smart** and **interactive**.


## 🚀 Skills
- **Languages:** Python
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, Django (learning), SQLAlchemy
- **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, SQL
- **Machine Learning / Data Science:** NLP, Classification, Reinforcement Learning, numpy, pandas, spaCy
- **Tools:** Git, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Other experience:** Java, PHP (past projects)


## 🎓 Education  
**B.Eng. in Computer Science** – University of Silesia<br>
Specialization: Designing of Web Application
Currently pursuing **M.Sc. in Computer Science**, focusing on AI applications.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🛍️ [Shoop - ML-powered E-commerce](https://github.com/bartoszstec/Shoop-machine-learning/tree/automatic)
A web-based e-commerce platform integrated with a custom-built classification model. It helps in categorizing products and enhancing user experience.<br>
 Tech stack: **Vue.js, Flask, and Scikit-learn**  
- Developed as my engineering thesis from scratch (data collection, preprocessing, model training, integration).
- ML model (Random Forest) trained on real-world e-commerce reviews.
- Classifies customer opinions as positive,negative or neutral to enhance user experience.

### 🎮 [Tic Tac Toe AI – Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/bartoszstec/tic_tac_toe)
An interactive Tic Tac Toe game with **AI opponent trained via Q-learning**.  
**Tech:** Flask, Python (RL), JavaScript (Canvas)  
- Full-stack project: JS frontend handles gameplay, Flask backend serves AI decisions.
- Includes game history logging and training visualizations.
- AI learns optimal strategy through self-play.
- :warning: Project in progress
