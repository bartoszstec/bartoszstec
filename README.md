Python | Flask | Machine Learning | Random Forest | Natural Language Processing | Sentiment Analysis | scikit-learn | spaCy | E-commerce


Web-based e-commerce platform enhanced with a custom machine learning model. Developed as my engineering thesis from scratch, the system integrates a Flask backend with a Vanilla JavaScript frontend and employs a Scikit-learn Random Forest model trained on hybrid data. It automatically classifies user opinions as positive, negative, or neutral to improve product discovery and overall user experience.

Python | Flask | REST API | Reinforcement Learning | Q-learning | NumPy | SciPy | Data Visualization

Interactive Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent trained from scratch using Q-learning reinforcement learning. This full-stack application combines a JavaScript Canvas frontend with a Python Flask backend, where the AI learns optimal strategy through self-play. The project also includes game history tracking and training visualizations to observe the learning process.
