## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a computer science graduate passionate about web development and machine learning.

## 🚀 Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript
- **Frontend Frameworks:** Vue.js
- **Databases:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:** NLP, Classification Models

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🛍️ [Shoop - ML-powered E-commerce](https://github.com/bartoszstec/Shoop-machine-learning)
A web-based e-commerce platform integrated with a custom-built classification model. It helps in categorizing products and enhancing user experience.
 Built with **Vue.js, Flask, and Scikit-learn**  
- Uses a **custom-trained NLP model** with **Random Forest** for automated product categorization  
- Developed as part of my **engineering thesis on AI-driven e-commerce solutions**  

### 🧠 Machine Learning Model
The text classification model is based on:
- **Random Forest Algorithm** – chosen for its robustness, ability to handle textual data, and ensemble-based decision-making.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using **spaCy** and the **pl_core_news_sm** language model for text tokenization, lemmatization, and linguistic analysis.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction, converting text into numerical representations.
- **Model serialization with Joblib** for efficient loading and inference.

The model was trained on **partly real-world e-commerce data** and tested using **confusion matrices** to evaluate classification performance.
